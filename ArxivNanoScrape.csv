triggered by the adequate stimulation and leading to the sequential release of
the smaller constituent elements. This review will focus on the possibilities
that this type of chemistry offers to nanomedicine research, which is an area
where the stimuli responsive behavior is always targeted. There are some
examples on the use of self-immolative chemistry for prodrugs or nanoparticles
for drug delivery, but there is still an exciting land of opportunities waiting
to be explored. This review aims at revising what has been done so far, but,
most importantly, it aims at inspiring new research of self-immolative

bloodstream glucose while aggregated in circumferential rings on capillary
walls is evaluated with a numerical model using axial symmetry and
time-averaged release of oxygen from passing red blood cells. Robots about one
micron in size can produce up to several tens of picowatts, in steady-state, if
they fully use oxygen reaching their surface from the blood plasma. Robots with
pumps and tanks for onboard oxygen storage could collect oxygen to support
burst power demands two to three orders of magnitude larger. We evaluate
effects of oxygen depletion and local heating on surrounding tissue. These
results give the power constraints when robots rely entirely on ambient
available oxygen and identify aspects of the robot design significantly
affecting available power. More generally, our numerical model provides an
approach to evaluating robot design choices for nanomedicine treatments in and

detected and manipulated by remote magnetic fields, it opens a wide opportunity
for them to be used in vivo. Nowadays, MNPs have been used for diverse
applications including magnetic biosensing (diagnostics), magnetic imaging,
magnetic separation, drug and gene delivery, and hyperthermia therapy, etc.
This review aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the state-of-the-art
biological and biomedical applications of MNPs. In addition, the development of
high magnetic moment MNPs with proper surface functionalization has progressed
exponentially over the past decade. Herein, we also reviewed the recent
advances in the synthesis and surface coating strategies of MNPs. This review
is not only to provide in-depth insights into the different synthesis,

Here, we develop a Generative Adversarial Network for Distribution Analysis
(GANDA) to describe and conditionally generates the intratumoral quantum dots
(QDs) distribution after i.v. injection. This deep generative model is trained
automatically by 27 775 patches of tumor vessels and cell nuclei decomposed
from whole-slide images of 4T1 breast cancer sections. The GANDA model can
conditionally generate images of intratumoral QDs distribution under the
constraint of given tumor vessels and cell nuclei channels with the same

Quantitative analysis of QDs extravasation distance (ICC = 0.95) and subarea
distribution (ICC = 0.99) is allowed on the generated images without knowing

opportunities to investigate how influencing factors affect NPs distribution in
individual tumors and guide nanomedicine optimization for molecular imaging and
personalized treatment."

possibility to obtain different responses triggered by safe remote stimulus.
However, such richness can be detrimental if the different performances are not
accurately differentiated (and controlled). An example of this is the
reorientation of magnetic nanoparticles under the influence of AC fields, which
can be exploited for either magneto-mechanical actuation (MMA) at low
frequencies (tens of Hz); or heat release at large ones (MHz range). While it
is clear that Brownian rotation is responsible for MMA, its heating role in the
high-frequency regime is not clear. In this work we aim to shed light on this
issue, which needs to be well understood for applications in magnetic fluid
hyperthermia (MFH) or heat triggered drug release. Using a Brownian dynamics
(BD) simulation technique, we have theoretically investigated the contribution
of Brownian reversal in disk-shape particles (to enhance the viscous
interaction with the environment) over a wide range of frequencies. Our results
predict essentially negligible hysteresis losses both in the high- and
low-frequency domains, with completely different implications: highly efficient
MMA, but negligible MFH performance. Importantly, complementary micromagnetic
simulations indicate that the large magnetic torque assumption of the BD
simulations is supported by hexagonal-shape disks, up to field amplitudes of
the order of 100 Oe. Larger fields would lead to N\'eel reversal which,
noteworthy, predicts significant heating performance. The possibility of
switching between the MMA and MFH response by changing the amplitude of the AC
field, together with their distinct optimal conditions (large magnetic torque
for MMF; large heating for MFH), points to such hexagonal nanodisks as
promising nanomedicine agents with double mechanical and heating
functionalities."

This paper models microscopic robots and red blood cells (erythrocytes) in
capillaries using realistic distorted cell shapes. The models evaluate two
sensing scenarios: robots moving with the cells past a chemical source on the
vessel wall, and robots attached to the wall for longer-term chemical
monitoring. Using axial symmetric geometry with realistic flow speeds and
diffusion coefficients, we compare detection performance with a simpler model
that does not include the cells. The average chemical absorption is
quantitatively similar in both models, indicating the simpler model is an
adequate design guide to sensor performance in capillaries. However,

magnetic fluid stabilized with two surfactants, natrium oleate as a first
surfactant and Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a second surfactant. The

nanoparticles arrange into rings or helices on stretchable nanotubes, and as
axial strings on nanotubes with high rigidity to stretching. These
self-assembled structures are inextricably linked to a variety of deformed
nanotube profiles, which can be controlled by tuning the concentration of

combined multiscale molecular dynamics simulations and complementary

Specifically, ubiquitins competed with citrates for the nanoparticle surface
and bound to the particle in a specific manner. Under a high
protein/nanoparticle stoichiometry, ubiquitions formed a multi-layer corona on
the particle surface. The binding exhibited an unusual stretched-exponential
behavior, suggesting a rich kinetics originated from protein-protein,
protein-citrate, and protein-nanoparticle interactions. Furthermore, the
binding destabilized the {\alpha}-helices while increasing the {\beta}-sheets
